Steps Completed so far:

1) data upload and inspection
2) removed rows missing more than 70 values
3) split data into categorical and numerical data frames
    3a) replaced all null values in the categorical data
    *fucked up, should have used all the available feature data in order to calculate the missing values because I encoded everything.
